        We have long recognized that there are many vacant openings for DevOps positions 
        and many willing talented candidates without the base knowledge required to 
        be accepted.
        Therefore and accordingly, <b>the Bakery</b> coaching track wants to stand to the 
        challenge!
    </p>
    <p>
        What's in the program:
        <ul>
            <li>The profession we chose to train - CI/CD</li>
            <li>About 15 weekly sessions</li>
            <li>Built-in mentoring</li>
            <li>Knowledge sharing by industry and profession veterans</li>
            <li>Practical workshops</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The program is an initiative of good people in the middle of the road. 
        Non-profit and no small print. Everything is on the table.
        If not understood from the previous sentence, then the intent is that 
        there is no commercial entity behind the initiative and it is at no cost
        to the participants.
        We want to share knowledge and help more quality people to reach the 
        professions of DevOps. And all that is voluntarily.
